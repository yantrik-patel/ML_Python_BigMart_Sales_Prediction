# ML_Python_Big_Mart_Sales_Prediction
This project is about analyzing Big Mart Sales data and choosing best Machine Learning model to do sales prediction.  
  
The dataset is opensource data available on Kaggle. Following is the path I have followed

(1) Data cleaning and Null Value imputation.  
(2) Numerical and Categorical Features Analysis.  
(3) Data Preprocessing and Label Encoding.  
(4) Data Splitting into 'Features' and 'Target' & 'Train' and 'Test'.  
(5) ML Model Training and Evaluation of performance.  
(6) Selection of best fit Model.
